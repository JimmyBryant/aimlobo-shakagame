{{< summary >}}

Recently, the Chinese economy has been persistently weak. It is widely known that the decline in housing prices is a significant factor. For instance, the down payment ratio has decreased from 30% to 20% currently. Policies such as considering the purchase of a second home by families with multiple children as a first-time purchase have been issued. These policies reflect the current administration's recognition of these issues and aim to stimulate consumption continuously. However, just like shopping, when prices drop, people tend to continue observing to see if prices will further decline. Therefore, the current outcomes are still not ideal. We will analyze the actual situation later on.

Different political systems and legal provisions in various countries lead to different outcomes for the same matter. Here, we specifically discuss the taxes and fees required for purchasing real estate in China. Later, we will discuss the requirements in more countries regarding the same matter.

Firstly, purchasing real estate involves a transaction where the property is transferred from the seller (transferor) to the buyer (transferee). This transaction involves property rights transfer, registration, appreciation, contract signing, etc., corresponding to various tax categories specified by tax laws and regulations. Below, we will discuss the taxes and some related issues involved in this transaction. Therefore, in this process, we will not only discuss taxes, but also some issues related to daily real estate purchases.

This article will comprehensively analyze the entire process of the real estate transaction in the following pattern: transaction details - legal basis - related taxes. It will also explain the methods, validity, and practicality of relevant regulations, so that readers can effectively refer to them in practical situations. This approach also aligns with the author's purpose of writing articles, which is effective, practical, and capable of addressing specific practical issues. Moreover, **unless otherwise specified, all laws and links mentioned in this article are valid as of the publication date**.

Firstly, it should be noted that in China, land is owned by the state and collectives(This statement is not entirely accurate because land ownership in rural areas actually belongs to rural collectives, but under China's political system, the final decision-making authority rests with local governments.). Individuals, enterprises, etc., only have the right to use the land. Therefore, local governments have actual management rights over land. The consequences of releasing more or less land are completely different, just like controlling the supply side of the market. Therefore, local housing prices are linked to local government revenues. Apart from the initial land allocation, subsequent real estate markets are where governments can gain more income. With a prosperous market and frequent transactions, the government can collect more taxes. In a sluggish market with fewer transactions, tax revenue decreases. Of course, different levels of economic development in China have a significant impact on urban housing markets. In first-tier cities like Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenzhen, even if more land is released, housing prices remain high. In western cities, even with less land released to the market, housing prices cannot rise. Ultimately, it still depends on population. With more population, there is naturally more demand, and housing prices rise accordingly. However, why do people gather and flow into a few specific large cities is still related to local policies and closely tied resources. Everyone knows that big cities have good educational and medical resources. It is indeed true when the population is reasonable. With more population, imbalance occurs, and the government has also noticed these situations. They have been exploring solutions, establishing satellite cities, reforming local policies, etc., but clear improvement results have not yet been observed. The final outcome awaits further observation.

This is to explain the ownership of land, such as the initial land allocation in the market (the government provides it to developers) and why there are these steps, etc. We will discuss this in future series. Here, it is just to introduce the concept that individuals and enterprises only have the right to use the land.

There are several situations. The seller can be a developer, an individual, or a real estate company, and the buyer can also be a company or an individual. Here, we discuss the two most common situations in reality, where buyers are individuals and sellers are developers or individuals.

I. Individuals purchasing a new house from a developer, i.e., using the house for residence.

1. Both parties sign a contract.

In the early stages of market development, the division of labor is already clear. Developers develop houses, and it may be another real estate company that sells them. However, we will use direct sales by developers as an example here.

After an individual decides to purchase a house, both parties sign a house purchase contract. According to the [People's Republic of China Stamp Tax Law](http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/chinatax/n367/c5165283/content.html#external), Article 1 states:

> Units and individuals within the territory of the People's Republic of China that issue taxable certificates or conduct securities transactions are taxpayers of stamp duty and shall pay stamp duty in accordance with the provisions of this Law.

Immediately following Article 2 states:

> The taxable certificate referred to in this Law refers to contracts, property transfer documents, and business books listed in the "Stamp Tax Tax Rate Table" attached to this Law.

When individuals buy a house, they are purchasing ownership of the house and a shared land use right, so it is a property transfer document. The corresponding tax rates are as follows:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100013/001.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

From here, we know that the stamp duty rate is 0.5%. Next is the tax base (tax base)ã€‚

Article 5 (2) of the law provides:

> The tax basis for taxable property transfer documents is the amount listed in the property transfer documents, excluding the VAT amount listed;

From this we can conclude: **When signing a house purchase contract, both the buyer and seller must pay stamp duty at a rate of 0.5% based on the amount specified in the contract.**

Below, we will introduce the place and time of stamp duty payment:

Article 13 of the law stipulates the place of tax payment:

> If the taxpayer is a unit, it shall declare and pay stamp duty to the competent tax authority of the institution where it is located; if the taxpayer is an individual, it shall declare and pay stamp duty to the competent tax authority of the place where the taxable certificate is issued or where the taxpayer resides.

> For the transfer of real estate property rights, the taxpayer shall declare and pay stamp duty to the competent tax authority where the real estate is located.

This means that wherever the purchased house is located, we will go to the local tax authority to pay taxes.

Article 15 of the law stipulates:

> The tax liability for stamp duty arises on the day when the taxpayer issues the taxable certificate or completes the securities transaction.

Article 16 stipulates:

> Stamp duty is levied quarterly, annually, or per transaction. If levied quarterly or annually, the taxpayer shall declare and pay the tax within fifteen days from the end of the quarter or year; **if levied per transaction, the taxpayer shall declare and pay the tax within fifteen days from the date when the tax liability arises.**

From this, we conclude: **From the day the house purchase contract is signed, both the buyer and seller have the obligation to pay stamp duty. The tax amount must be paid to the local tax authority where the property is located within fifteen days from the contract signing date (inclusive).**

After the tax payment is completed, the tax authority will issue a stamp duty certificate or an equivalent tax payment certificate to the payer to prove that the taxpayer has completed the tax payment. The bold marks here indicate two different subjects: the funds received by the tax authority are paid by the payer, not necessarily by the taxpayer himself; second, the taxpayer in this matter is both parties to the house purchase contract, and the tax certificate must include the names of both buyer and seller.

Now, let's discuss **special considerations (tax exemptions)**:

According to the [Ministry of Finance, State Administration of Taxation Notice on Adjusting Tax Policies for Real Estate Transaction Links](http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/chinatax/n369/c4181/content.html#external), Article 2 stipulates:

> Individuals selling or purchasing residential housing are temporarily exempt from stamp duty.

This notice has been implemented since November 1, 2008, which means that the current provisions (as of the publication date of this article) are: **Individuals buying or selling residential housing are exempt from paying stamp duty**.

As you can see, no matter how many laws are mentioned in front of them, there must be a special rule to give a conclusion, of course, for us individuals, this is a good thing. It is worth mentioning that units should pay as they pay, and the above regulations are only applicable to individuals and residential housing.

The above is about stamp duty for individuals purchasing residential housing, and all relevant regulations can be clicked on the blue font in this section for jumping and querying to confirm whether they are still valid.
