{{< summary >}}

In recent years, online discussions about China's value-added tax have been abundant, but in practice, I found that most articles are theoretical and cannot provide clear answers when I encountered problems in querying. Of course, everyone's environment and perspectives vary, resulting in diverse content. In light of this, this article is based on my own experiences and concerns, compiling knowledge and foundational data that will be updated based on policy changes to provide readers with timely and accurate information. I hope this can be of help.

This article covers:

1. How to query and obtain current effective regulations and policies related to value-added tax.
   
2. Definition and criteria for current effective value-added tax taxpayers.

The second point will be directly addressed in this article and manually updated by me with policy changes. Updates will be noted with dates and details changed, facilitating direct access to the latest data for readers. For those who wish to independently acquire information, the first point describes the methods I use to obtain relevant information, aiming to empower others with tools rather than just answers.

## 1. How to Query and Obtain Current Effective Regulations and Policies Related to Value-Added Tax

Understanding a country or region's regulations is crucial, starting from basic constitutional or similar laws, extending to various regulations, their effectiveness, and hierarchies. Knowing these basics helps in accessing and utilizing relevant information. This aspect won't be detailed here; I may address it in a separate article later. Now, back to the topic, **China's legal documents related to value-added tax currently include two: the Provisional Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Value-Added Tax, and the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Value-Added Tax**. Here's how to directly access the relevant policies:

National Legal Database

Keyword: Provisional Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Value-Added Tax

[Click here to view results](https://flk.npc.gov.cn/detail2.html?ZmY4MDgwODE2ZjNjYmIzYzAxNmY0MTE4NGY5YjE2ZDA%3D#external) (Updated: June 2024)

The above query results contain the currently effective Provisional Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Value-Added Tax. It's important to note that as of the writing of this article, China has not yet promulgated laws specifically for value-added tax. The current provisional regulations serve as the highest legal authority concerning value-added tax, enacted by the State Council of China on November 19, 2017.

It's worth mentioning that the National Legal Database is maintained by the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of China. It currently provides electronic texts of the Constitution (including amendments), laws, administrative regulations, supervisory regulations, local regulations, autonomous regulations, economic zone regulations, and judicial interpretations of the People's Republic of China. This means that various other laws and regulations can also be queried here. This is an official website provided by China for queries.

Additionally, it should be noted that this website only queries provisional regulations on value-added tax; specific implementing rules cannot be queried here as these are formulated by the Ministry of Finance and can be queried on the Ministry of Finance or State Taxation Administration official websites.

[Provisional Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Value-Added Tax](https://www.chinatax.gov.cn/chinatax/n810341/n810825/c101434/c29917171/content.html#external):

Some readers may wonder, "Why bother placing value-added tax in the second position? Can't I just go directly to the Taxation Bureau's official website?" There's a reason for this. The State Taxation Administration's Tax Policy Repository supports simple and direct queries, using wildcard searches, meaning that results containing partial keywords will be displayed. This can make it challenging for straightforward searches like mine to quickly find desired results. However, **advanced searches allow for precise queries, assuming the accurate name of the relevant regulations is known**. Therefore, for readers unfamiliar with value-added tax regulations, you can directly use the query results prepared by me above.

However, it is **strongly recommended** that friends who have a need for Chinese tax law should fully grasp and utilize this Tax Policy Repository because it contains all Chinese tax-related regulations, announcements, notices, and other documents. The data provided in the following sections is obtained from here, and in terms of comprehensive information, making good use of this website is sufficient.

## 2. Definition and Criteria for Current Effective Value-Added Tax Taxpayers

### Definition of Value-Added Tax Taxpayers

Units and individuals within the People's Republic of China that sell goods, process, repair, or provide labor services, sell services, intangible assets, real estate, and import goods are taxpayers of value-added tax.

### Criteria for Determining Value-Added Tax Taxpayers

Individuals refer to individual consumers; we won't discuss them here. Our focus is on units, particularly enterprises.

1. Criteria for determining small-scale value-added tax taxpayers (Updated: June 2024):
   
2. Annual taxable sales of value-added tax of 5 million yuan or less;
   
3. According to Article 28 of the Implementing Rules of the Provisional Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Value-Added Tax, units and individuals registered as general taxpayers of value-added tax before December 31, 2018, can transfer to small-scale taxpayers, effective from May 1, 2018.

It's worth mentioning that from April 1, 2021, to December 31, 2022, value-added tax small-scale taxpayers with monthly sales of 1.5 million yuan or less (including this amount) are exempt from value-added tax. This is a preferential policy introduced by the country for small-scale taxpayers significantly affected by the epidemic.

The standard for general value-added tax taxpayers is annual taxable sales of value-added tax exceeding 5 million yuan. Please note, this is just a monetary definition; in practice, it also involves whether there is a fixed operating location, whether accounting is sound, etc., but these are not our main focus, so they are omitted.
