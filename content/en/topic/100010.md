## 1. Basic Information on Vietnamese Law

In the late 19th century, Vietnam was colonized by France. In 1954, North Vietnam gained independence, while South Vietnam remained under French colonial rule, later governed by the United States. The Anti-American Resistance War (the Vietnam War) broke out in 1961. In 1975, North Vietnam conquered South Vietnam, leading to the liberation of the South. In 1976, the country was unified.

Vietnam follows a socialist legal system based on civil law. The National Assembly is the highest representative body of the people and the highest state authority, possessing legislative functions. The judicial system comprises the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuracy, local courts, local procuracies, and military courts. The Supreme People's Court is led by the Chief Justice, who is appointed by the National Assembly.

Vietnam's current tax laws and regulations include the following types of taxes: corporate income tax, value-added tax (VAT), personal income tax, withholding tax, special consumption tax, non-agricultural land use tax, business license tax, social security tax, import-export tax, environmental protection tax, and resource tax. Here is a brief overview of the tax rates for corporate income tax and VAT: the basic corporate income tax rate is 20%, personal income tax has a seven-bracket progressive rate, and the basic VAT rate is 10%. It is worth mentioning that in response to the impact of the pandemic, many countries have introduced policies to alleviate the burden on businesses. Vietnam also allows eligible enterprises to enjoy a 30% reduction in corporate income tax.

Now, let's return to the main topic of this article: methods for querying laws.

## 2. Methods for Querying Vietnamese Laws

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100010/001.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

This is the [legal database operated by the Ministry of Justice of Vietnam](http://vbpl.vn/pages/portal.aspx#external), where you can search for the Constitution, laws, ordinances, directives, and other normative legal documents of Vietnam. The database provides versions in both English and Vietnamese. Users can use Google Chrome to translate the content into their preferred language. The red box in the image above marks the entrance to the English version. Click to see:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100010/002.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

It should be noted that **some legal documents are only available in Vietnamese, and the English version only includes a portion of them. Therefore, for readers who need comprehensive information, it is recommended to use the Vietnamese version directly. If the language is unfamiliar, a translator can be used to translate the content**.

For the convenience of later demonstrations, we will use the English version of the interface for the following search demonstrations.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100010/003.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Before introducing specific search methods, let's first go over the various parts of the interface. Since the website does not provide a user guide, new users might find it unfamiliar without any documentation.

As shown in the image above, the first red box in the upper left corner indicates that the default search mode is "Legal normative documents," which is a regular search. The "Consolidated Document" option below represents a comprehensive search that includes various contents. Usually, the default search is sufficient to meet the information needs.

The second red box in the lower left corner indicates the issuing body, such as the National Assembly, the Legislative Committee, the government, or the Prime Minister. The third red box in the lower left corner indicates the classification of the legal documents, such as whether the document is the highest-level Constitution, top-tier laws, or departmental resolutions.

Careful readers might have noticed from the black bold titles of individual documents in the image above that each document's naming follows a specific rule: the first part indicates the document type, followed by the document number. Below, there is a version in another language (if available; some documents are only in Vietnamese) and other related documents. This feature is very useful because if cross-referencing clauses between documents is involved, this function allows for easier retrieval of related documents, facilitating searches. Additionally, each document has attributes, as shown in the image:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100010/004.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Through the attribute page, you can clearly see the document's official number, publication date, effective date, document type, scope of validity, issuing agency, etc. Another important aspect is the "Effect Status," which indicates the document's validity status. "Effective" means the document is in force, while "Expired" means it is no longer valid.

Now, let's introduce the methods for querying Vietnamese laws. Basic searches include keyword searches by title and full text, with filters for publication date and other criteria. Advanced searches offer more precise conditions such as document type, issuing agency, and validity status.

The website also supports downloading documents for offline reading. Users can directly click "download" or "print" to achieve the same function. Be sure to select the language when downloading, as some documents are only available in Vietnamese and do not have English versions.

## 3. Methods for Querying Vietnamese Tax Laws

Similar to the legal query website, the [Vietnam General Department of Taxation website](https://www.gdt.gov.vn/wps/portal/#external) defaults to Vietnamese but also provides an English version, as shown:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100010/006.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The English interface looks like this:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100010/007.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

From here, readers can see that the English interface supports limited functions, providing only tax information, documents, and tax treaties. Therefore, to obtain relevant information such as declarations, it is necessary to return to the Vietnamese interface.

Continuing with how to query relevant tax laws on the tax website, as shown:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100010/008.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

In the "Documents" section, set the filter criteria to quickly obtain the desired tax documents. The red box in the image indicates where users can select the type of tax. You can also narrow down the search by document number, publication date, document type, and issuing agency. The downside is that a verification code must be entered each time. Additionally, note that some documents are only available in Vietnamese, so if the English search yields no results, try searching on the Vietnamese interface. The search methods are consistent.
