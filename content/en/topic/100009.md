## 1. Basic Information about Indian Law

First, let's introduce the general situation of India: India is a federal country, a democratic republic, and adopts the British-style parliamentary democracy. The Federal Parliament consists of the President and two houses. The President is the head of state and the commander-in-chief of the armed forces, elected by an electoral college composed of elected members of both houses of Parliament and state legislatures for a five-year term. The President exercises his powers on the advice of the Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister. The two houses are the Rajya Sabha (Upper House) and the Lok Sabha (Lower House). The Rajya Sabha has 250 seats, with 12 members appointed by the President who have special knowledge or practical experience, and no more than 238 representatives of the states and union territories, serving six-year terms, with one-third being re-elected every two years. The Rajya Sabha meets four times a year. The Constitution stipulates that the Vice President is the ex-officio Chairman of the Rajya Sabha. **The Lok Sabha is the main legislative body of the country, and its main functions are: making laws and amending the Constitution**; controlling and adjusting the revenue and expenditure of the federal government; proposing no-confidence motions against the federal government, and having the power to impeach the President. Therefore, as seen in the bold text, law queries should be made from the Lok Sabha website.

Additionally, the Supreme Court is the highest judicial authority, with the power to interpret the Constitution and adjudicate disputes between the central government and the states. Each state has a High Court, and each district has a District Court. Judges of the Supreme Court are appointed by the President. The Attorney General is appointed by the government, and his main duties are to provide consultation and advice to the government on legal matters, exercise prosecutorial powers as stipulated by the Constitution and laws, and supervise the implementation of the Constitution and laws. The Council of Ministers headed by the Prime Minister is the highest administrative body. From this, we can conclude the design of the power structure: separation and supervision - Parliament makes laws, judges are appointed by the President, and the Attorney General is appointed by the government represented by the Prime Minister, forming a separation of powers with mutual checks and balances.

Now back to the main topic of this article, the methods for querying laws.

## 2. Methods for Querying Indian Laws

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100009/001.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The [India Code](https://www.indiacode.nic.in/external) website, maintained by the Ministry of Law and Justice of the Government of India, is the official site for querying effective laws in India. It is worth mentioning that both central and state laws can be queried here, and it supports two languages, English and Hindi.

The website provides an official user guide, located at the bottom right of the homepage, presented as a PDF document. It is recommended to read it first for initial use, as it greatly helps in using the site.

Here are several common query methods:

1. Basic Search, supporting wildcard searches using the symbol "*", for example, "nation":

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100009/002.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

2. Advanced Search

Supports the use of: and, or, not, here using "and" as an example:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100009/003.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Additionally, the site supports queries by title, act number, year, department, etc., specifically under "Browse Central Acts";

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100009/004.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Laws of various states in India can be queried under "State Acts":

## 3. Methods for Querying Indian Tax Laws

Attentive readers may have noticed from the first image of this article that there is a separate page for tax laws:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100009/006.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The reason is that relevant tax laws are directly queried on the [Income Tax Department website](https://www.incometaxindia.gov.in/pages/indiacode/tax-laws-rules.aspx#external), as shown on the homepage below.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100009/007.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

It is necessary to note here that Income Tax and GST in India are separate, meaning they are not on the same website. The above image is from the Income Tax website.

The [official GST website](https://cbic-gst.gov.in/index.html#external):

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100009/008.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

To explain why there are two websites: firstly, Income Tax is managed by the Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT), Department of Revenue, while GST is managed by the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs. One is a direct tax, and the other is an indirect tax, hence they are separated into two sites.

Additionally, regarding GST, it should be noted that as shown above, some are labeled as CGST, and some as IGST. Here, C stands for Central, indicating that GST is also divided between central and state.

Overall, querying Indian tax laws is relatively straightforward, similar to the legal query methods introduced at the beginning of this page. Readers can refer to the previous section for guidance.
