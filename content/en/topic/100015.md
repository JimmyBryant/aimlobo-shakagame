## I. Current Effective Scope of Value-Added Tax Collection, Tax Rates, Calculation Methods (Update Date: June 2024)

Article 2 of China's Provisional Regulations on Value-Added Tax clearly defines the scope of value-added tax collection and related tax rates. The following excerpt elaborates on this:

- Taxpayers selling goods, services, tangible movable property leasing services, or importing goods, unless otherwise specified in articles 2, 4, and 5, are subject to a tax rate of 13%. (Author's note: Updated to the latest tax rate based on current policies)
- Taxpayers selling transportation, postal, basic telecommunications, construction, real estate leasing services, selling real estate, transferring land use rights, or selling/importing the following goods are subject to a tax rate of 9%:
    - Grain and other agricultural products, edible vegetable oil, edible salt;
    - Tap water, heating, cooling, hot water, gas, liquefied petroleum gas, natural gas, dimethyl ether, biogas, residential coal products;
    - Books, newspapers, magazines, audiovisual products, electronic publications;
    - Feed, fertilizers, pesticides, agricultural machinery, agricultural film;
    - Other goods as stipulated by the State Council.
- Taxpayers selling services, intangible assets, except as otherwise provided in items 1, 2, and 5 of this article, are subject to a tax rate of 6%.
- Taxpayers exporting goods are subject to a zero tax rate; however, exceptions apply as stipulated by the State Council.
- Domestic entities and individuals selling services or intangible assets across borders within the scope stipulated by the State Council are subject to a zero tax rate.

Additional points mentioned here:

(1) For taxpayers purchasing agricultural products originally subject to a 10% deduction rate, this rate has been adjusted to 9%. For taxpayers purchasing agricultural products for use in production or entrusted processing of goods taxed at 13%, the deduction rate for input tax is calculated at 10%.

This adjustment has undergone changes according to provisional regulations. As of May 2018, taxpayers purchasing agricultural products originally subject to an 11% deduction rate had this rate adjusted to 10%. By April 2019, this rate was further adjusted to 9%. For agricultural products used in production or entrusted processing of goods taxed at 13%, the input tax is calculated at a deduction rate of 10%. Therefore, the content mentioned earlier in this article is based on the latest updated data, which readers can directly utilize.

(2) For exported goods and services originally subject to a 16% tax rate and an export tax rebate rate of 16%, this rebate rate has been adjusted to 13%. For exported goods and cross-border taxable activities originally subject to a 10% tax rate and an export tax rebate rate of 10%, this rebate rate has been adjusted to 9%.

This adjustment has undergone changes according to provisional regulations. As of May 2018, goods and services originally subject to a 17% tax rate and an export tax rebate rate of 17% had their rebate rate adjusted to 16%. For goods and cross-border taxable activities originally subject to an 11% tax rate and an export tax rebate rate of 11%, this rate was adjusted to 10% by April 2019. Therefore, the content mentioned earlier in this article is based on the latest updated data, which readers can directly utilize.



### Calculation Method of Value-Added Tax

Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations specifies: Tax payable = current output tax - current input tax. The principle is based on taxing the added value at each stage. Output tax is calculated based on the sales amount of the seller for the current period, using the applicable tax rate, and collected by the seller on behalf of the tax authority from downstream purchasers, subsequently remitted to the tax authority. When sellers themselves purchase products from upstream suppliers, the selling seller collects value-added tax on their behalf, generating input tax. The current output tax minus the current input tax equals the current tax payable, which is theoretically sound. **However, in practice, this is disadvantageous for relatively junior upstream purchasers, such as individuals, sole proprietors, small-scale taxpayers, and others, who often lack sound accounting practices or the ability to issue invoices, thereby increasing the tax burden for purchasers and reducing profits.** For example, basic mineral sales, sand, minerals, vegetables, etc.



## II. How to Obtain the Latest Authoritative Documents When Policies Related to Value-Added Tax Change

Here, the author shares their method for obtaining the latest authoritative documents on various policy matters. As mentioned in Series I, the main source is the Tax Policy Database of China's State Administration of Taxation, which has been digitized. All tax policy documents are updated in this repository and arranged chronologically (the latest documents appear first), [click here to search](https://fgk.chinatax.gov.cn/zcfgk/index.html#external);

Generally, browsing the first 1-2 pages allows users to understand the recent changes in content. However, the content is extensive, covering various tax types and aspects. For specific queries, users can initially use a simple search to see if it resolves the issue. If not, use the [**Advanced Search**](https://fgk.chinatax.gov.cn/zcfgk/c100028/search.html#external)

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100015/002.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Through keyword searches of titles or full texts, or by using document numbers and publication dates to narrow down the search scope, results from the Advanced Search are usually precise, not exceeding 2 pages. If the Advanced Search fails to retrieve relevant policies, consulting the tax authorities is necessary to obtain the latest authoritative documents.
