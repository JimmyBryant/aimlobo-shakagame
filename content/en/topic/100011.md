Law is the fundamental normative document of a country or region, and it is necessary for the public to understand some laws that are directly relevant to their daily lives. However, due to limitations in accessing basic information or other objective factors, many people lack understanding of the laws of their own country or region, and some may not even know where to obtain such information. Recognizing this, the author has compiled methods for querying laws in various countries or regions, all of which are free and accessible via the internet, hoping to be helpful to readers. This series will be continuously updated, with the author promptly updating whenever there are changes in legal querying methods for different countries or regions. Because all methods have been personally tested by the author repeatedly before publication, updates may lag slightly, for which the author asks readers' understanding. If there is an urgent need for information on the laws of specific countries or regions, readers are encouraged to leave a message, and the author will update accordingly to progress together.

This article focuses on the methods for querying Chinese laws, including the avenues for queries and introductions to basic legal information. Of course, the emphasis is on tax laws, but other laws will also be mentioned.

## I. Basic Information on Chinese Laws

Chinese laws are deliberated and passed by the National People's Congress and its Standing Committee. There are various types of laws in China, including laws, administrative regulations, local regulations, rules, local government regulations, autonomous regulations, single-line regulations, economic zone regulations, departmental regulations, and military regulations.

In terms of legal systems, mainland China, Macau SAR, and Taiwan are all civil law systems, while the Hong Kong SAR follows common law (derived from the UK). Different legal systems significantly impact judicial interpretation and legal authority. Common law's notable feature is its adherence to precedent, ensuring judges are not influenced when adjudicating cases.

Chinese laws are categorized into the Constitution, substantive laws, and procedural laws. The Constitution holds the highest legal authority, followed by the three fundamental substantive laws (Civil Law, Criminal Law, and Administrative Law) and three fundamental procedural laws (Civil Procedure Law, Criminal Procedure Law, and Administrative Procedure Law).

## II. Methods for Querying Chinese Laws

The [**National Laws and Regulations Database**](https://flk.npc.gov.cn/index.html#external) is maintained by the General Office of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and is the official website for querying current Chinese laws.

The Constitution, as the fundamental law, has its dedicated page containing the original version and all amendments. It's important to note that the latest version is the 2018 amended edition.

For first-time users of the website, it's advisable to read the **Search Instructions** in the top right corner, which provides detailed official search methods. Here's a simplified summary:

### 1. Basic Search

If unsure about the name, issuing authority, nature, effectiveness, or date of relevant laws, users can enter keywords directly. The system supports wildcard searches. For example, using "enterprise" as a keyword yields results like the following:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100011/003.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Readers seeking tax laws can easily find the current "Enterprise Income Tax Law" file, as indicated by the red box in the image above. This provides basic information such as enactment by the National People's Congress on December 29, 2018, and current validity. Clicking on it opens the document for viewing or downloading.

Careful readers will also note information on the legal effect hierarchy, which indicates the position of each regulation (with the Constitution being the highest).

### 2. Advanced Search

Advanced search allows for more precise and rapid identification of relevant laws, reducing unrelated content. It requires more detailed input but offers options such as searching by title, content, or both, as well as by date, effectiveness, and whether to perform an exact or fuzzy search. Based on practical needs, users can select applicable laws for reference by entering titles and choosing "effective" for precise results.

## III. Methods for Querying Chinese Tax Laws

The general methods for legal queries have been covered above. Here, we specifically address the methods for querying Chinese tax laws. While the aforementioned methods can provide some information, they may not be comprehensive due to the lack of specific laws for certain taxes as of the current date (September 2023), which are governed by provisional regulations. Therefore, querying needs to be done through the official website of the State Administration of Taxation. Readers familiar with our previous article [《A Brief Introduction to VAT in China Series Part I》](../100014) can skip the subsequent content.

This article primarily covers the basic information on Chinese laws, methods for basic and advanced legal queries, and methods for querying Chinese tax laws. We hope it proves helpful to readers, and future articles will continue to introduce methods for legal queries in various countries or regions, with timely updates.
