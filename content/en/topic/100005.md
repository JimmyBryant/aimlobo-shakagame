## I. Basic Information on U.S. Law

As a globally renowned superpower, the United States of America has developed from a colony to a first-class nation in terms of economy, military, technology, and culture over more than 200 years of its founding. This development is believed to be closely related to the ideology of its people. From the Declaration of Independence to the Revolutionary War, the establishment of the Federation, and the Civil War, the attitudes of Americans towards individuals and laws—democracy and freedom—are evident. When the Founding Fathers gathered to discuss the constitution of the federal nation, they revealed the inherent American spirit of pragmatism and rigor.

As a federal country with a long constitutional history, the constitution drafted more than 200 years ago is still in operation, along with the amendments to the constitution, propelling the country forward. The spirit of openness, the pursuit of individual freedom, and a distrust of government are vividly reflected in the law. The principle of the separation of powers was established at the founding of the nation. The Founding Fathers, traveling from various states, brought their states' interests to negotiate and compromise to form a united federation. This process of contention and compromise created a great nation and laid the foundation for future generations, all running according to established rules—laws.

Legislative power in the United States is vested in Congress, which consists of two houses. The Senate is composed of two representatives from each of the 50 states, while the House of Representatives is elected based on the population of each state. The election of these two houses reflects the principle that states with larger populations should have more representatives, while states with smaller populations should not be disadvantaged in asserting their rights. Thus, each state having two senators balances this issue, while the House of Representatives, with more representatives for larger populations, is logical. Representatives are elected by the people of each state, reflecting the state's interests and demands; otherwise, they won't be elected, showcasing democratic practices in power operations.

Congress legislates, the courts adjudicate, and the government enforces the laws. Everything operates smoothly under the constitution, following case law and statutory law. If unprecedented situations arise, public attention will push the case to the Supreme Court, which will rule on the matter based on constitutional interpretation, setting a precedent for the future. Thus, this vast yet precise system will self-correct where needed, embodying the essence of the law.

The pioneers on the Mayflower who landed on the North American continent might not have imagined that their descendants would build the land into what it is today. Similarly, the various races and people of different skin colors who integrated into this nation might not have foreseen its current state. It is the voice and demands of each individual that have shaped this democracy-first country. Reflecting on historical events, the birth of the Bill of Rights leaves one in awe.

The author came to understand this country by reading Linda's books, which introduced various events and the underlying logic, leaving a deep impression. Now, returning to the topic of this article, here are some relevant legal matters.

The U.S. Constitution holds the highest authority. Federal agencies operate based on powers granted by the federal constitution. However, each state can legislate independently. Matters such as national defense and foreign affairs are managed by the federal government, while local affairs are mostly managed by state legislation. Therefore, the same issue might be legal in one state and illegal in another.

This leads to the problem of legal query workload. Federal laws can be found in one place, but each of the fifty states has its own legal document repository, creating a vast amount of work. However, the query methods are fundamentally the same. This article will introduce methods to query federal laws and the laws of one state. Other states' query addresses will be provided for readers to use directly without introducing each state separately.

## II. Methods to Query U.S. Laws

1. <a href="https://www.archives.gov/founding-docs/constitution" target="_blank">U.S. Constitution</a> As a highly recognized constitution, it is worth mentioning separately.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100005/001.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Readers can notice the word "Founding" in the upper right red box, which means the foundation. Here, it signifies that the constitution lays the foundation of the nation. The red box below shows the original manuscript, where you can see the signatures of the signatories. Users can browse the full text of the U.S. Constitution here. The brief four-page content encapsulates the Founding Fathers' complete vision for the nation, which is admirable.

2. <a href="http://uscode.house.gov/" target="_blank">United States Code</a>, the code is divided into 54 titles. Once a law is passed, the House of Representatives publishes the content in the United States Code, where readers can see all the passed laws.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100005/002.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

3. <a href="https://www.ecfr.gov/" target="_blank">Federal Regulations</a>

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100005/003.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As shown above, users can directly enter the index to jump to a specific section. Under the title, you can click on a specific item to view the details. Note that if there is content in the red box marked "recent changes" on the right, it indicates subsequent changes to that section. Users needing comprehensive information on the rule should also read this section.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100005/004.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Here, a specific article's content is used to illustrate how to view U.S. laws: Each title in the federal regulations is divided into titles, chapters, parts, sections, and paragraphs (indicated by lowercase letters according to American practice). Each title is divided into different chapters according to the issuing department, and each chapter is further divided into different items based on specific regulations.

4. <a href="https://guides.loc.gov/law-library" target="_blank">State Laws</a>

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100005/005.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As shown in the image, the website categorizes laws into 33 topics. Readers can browse further on their own. Here, we will demonstrate how to query state laws according to the theme of this article. The red box marked above is the entry point for querying state laws. Let's select a state for demonstration:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100005/006.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As shown, the laws of each state are organized under categories such as state constitution, executive, judiciary, legislative, guides, and other resources. Users can click on the desired legal document level directly. The reading method is consistent with that of the code and federal regulations, which is a user-friendly aspect of U.S. legal websites, avoiding the need to learn different usage methods.

Users can query the laws of any state by directly entering the respective state's interface.

## III. Methods to Query U.S. Tax Laws

The method of querying U.S. tax laws is different from that of other countries. In a sense, it is better because tax law is part of the law and should theoretically be queryable in the legal section. In some countries, tax laws need to be queried separately on the tax bureau's website. This is because, besides the highest authority of laws, there are various rules, regulations, notifications, and provisions issued by the tax authorities that are not legally binding. The IRS (Internal Revenue Service) is the U.S. tax bureau, and its website offers very straightforward functions, **but it does not provide a tax law query function**. The following image shows the functions provided by the website:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100005/007.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The functions offered by the website are directly related to tax operations: filing, paying, refunds, and tax return forms and guides. It supports multiple languages, but the documents are provided only in English, with no versions in other languages. Users with practical tax needs can click on the "instructions" button, where each operation is explained.

Here, we continue to discuss the method of querying U.S. tax laws:

Firstly, federal tax law can be queried on the same website as other laws, as shown in the image:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100005/008.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Clicking on it allows you to see the relevant federal tax law content:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100005/009.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Local state tax laws can be queried directly in the legal query method introduced in the previous section by searching for tax-related chapters. Here, we use Delaware as an example:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100005/010.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As shown, you can search for "tax" under the state's constitution to see the relevant tax laws. The method for querying other states' tax laws is consistent with the demonstration above. Readers can search and browse according to their needs.
