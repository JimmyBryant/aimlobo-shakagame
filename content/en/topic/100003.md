## I. Basic Information on Japanese Law

Japan, a highly developed country located in East Asia, consists of four main islands (Hokkaido, Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu) and numerous smaller islands. Its area is approximately 378,000 square kilometers. The entire territory is surrounded by the Pacific Ocean, the Sea of Okhotsk, the Sea of Japan, and the East China Sea. To the west, it neighbors the Korean Peninsula and the Russian Far East, to the northeast, the Kuril Islands, and to the southwest, Taiwan and mainland China. With a population of 124.1 million, Japan is the 11th most populous country in the world. Over 35 million people reside in the Tokyo Metropolitan Area, making it the world's largest urban agglomeration.

Japan is a constitutional monarchy with a parliamentary cabinet system, and it has a separation of powers among the legislative, judicial, and executive branches. The Emperor is the head of state but does not participate in government affairs. The National Diet is the highest authority and the sole legislative body, comprising the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors. The Cabinet is the highest administrative body, responsible to the National Diet, and the Prime Minister (also known as the Cabinet Prime Minister) is elected by the National Diet and appointed by the Emperor.

The early modernization of Japanese law was primarily based on continental European law, with minimal influence from Anglo-American law. In the early Meiji era, European legal systems, especially the civil codes of Germany and France, served as the main models for Japan's judicial and legal systems. After World War II, influenced by American law, Japan reformed its legal system, making significant amendments to its Constitution, Criminal Procedure Law, Labor Law, and Company Law.

Japan's Constitution, also known as the MacArthur Constitution, was drafted under the supervision of General Douglas MacArthur during the Allied occupation of Japan after World War II. It transformed Japan's previous dual constitutional monarchy into a complete constitutional monarchy, significantly reducing the Emperor's powers. The Constitution is best known for Article 9, which states that Japan renounces the right to wage war and maintain military forces.

Since its promulgation in 1947, Japan's Constitution has not been amended. Article 96 stipulates that amendments can be made if approved by a two-thirds majority in both houses of the National Diet and a simple majority in a national referendum. The Emperor promulgates the amendments in the name of the people and cannot veto them.

In Japan, judicial power belongs to the Supreme Court and lower courts, operating under a "four-level, three-instance" system. The Supreme Court is the court of final appeal, handling constitutional and other significant cases. There are eight high courts nationwide, responsible for second-instance trials. Each prefecture (including Hokkaido, which has four) has a district court responsible for first-instance trials. Additionally, there are summary and family courts throughout the country handling civil and minor criminal cases. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court is nominated by the Cabinet and appointed by the Emperor; the other 14 justices are appointed by the Cabinet and must undergo a national review. Judges of lower courts are nominated by the Supreme Court and appointed by the Cabinet for ten-year terms, which are renewable. Judges cannot be removed from office except through formal impeachment.

Next, let's introduce how to search for Japanese laws. As mentioned earlier, I will provide a brief translation for readers to understand.

## II. Methods of Searching Japanese Laws

1. <a href="https://elaws.e-gov.go.jp/" target="_blank">Japanese Law Database (Japanese)</a>

   {{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100003/001.png" alt="japan law database" imageWidth=70 >}}

   This database is provided by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications of Japan and is a Japanese language database of Japanese laws. It offers searches by keywords in the law titles (法令名の用語索引), the first syllable of the law titles (五十音索引), the category of the laws (事項別分類索引), and the law number (法令番号検索), as well as full-text keyword searches (法令用語検索). You can also use Google Translate to read in your preferred language.

   Notably, you can conduct detailed searches for legal information specific to particular industries:

2. <a href="https://www.japaneselawtranslation.go.jp/" target="_blank">Japanese Law Translation Database (English)</a>
   
   This database is provided by the Ministry of Justice of Japan. However, the English translations are not official versions; if there is a conflict between the English and Japanese versions, the Japanese version prevails. The website offers full texts of laws in Japanese and English, searchable by Japanese keywords, and you can use Google Translate to read in your preferred language.

   {{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100003/004.png" alt="japan law database detail" imageWidth=70 >}}

   Here is an example to demonstrate: if we want to search for the Income Tax Act, we can type "income" into the search box and click search.

   {{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100003/005.png" alt="japan law database detail" imageWidth=70 >}}

   Many relevant results will appear, with the first item being the law with the highest authority, the "Act." By clicking on this item, you can browse the full text.

3. <a href="https://www.ndl.go.jp/index.html" target="_blank">National Diet Library of Japan</a>
   
   This is an additional resource I found for searching Japanese laws. It is available in Japanese, English, Simplified Chinese, and Korean, although most documents are in Japanese, with some in English.

   {{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100003/007.png" alt="japan law database detail" imageWidth=70 >}}

   An interesting feature here is the ability to <a href="https://dajokan.ndl.go.jp/#/" target="_blank">view the process of drafting, amending, and abolishing laws from the early Meiji period</a>.

4. <a href="https://www.courts.go.jp/index.html" target="_blank">Japanese Courts Website</a>

    {{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100003/008.png" alt="japan law database detail" imageWidth=70 >}}

    This website is available in Japanese and English, providing information on the judicial structure, case rulings, and legal searches in Japan.

## III. Methods of Searching Japanese Tax Laws

First, information related to taxes in Japan can be found on the <a href="https://www.nta.go.jp/" target="_blank">National Tax Agency of Japan website</a>, available in Japanese and English.

The following image shows the entrance for searching Japanese tax laws, which redirects to the Japanese Law Database website.
