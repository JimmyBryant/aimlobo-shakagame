## I. Basic Information about South African Law

South Africa, located at the southern tip of the African continent, is the second largest economy in Africa with a high standard of living among African nations. It is classified as an upper-middle-income developing country with a relatively open economy and an investment environment that leads other African nations. The country is divided into nine provinces for administrative purposes. Unlike many countries, South Africa has three capitals: Pretoria (administrative capital, where the central government is located), Cape Town (legislative capital, where the national parliament is located), and Bloemfontein (judicial capital, where the Supreme Court of Appeal is located). South Africa is a multi-ethnic country known as the "Rainbow Nation," but it experienced intense racial segregation conflicts in the latter half of the 20th century.

South African law is a hybrid system, reflecting the country’s historical development. Indigenous customary law and tribal courts have been preserved, while British common law and Roman-Dutch law have dominated since the 17th century. South Africa has a separation of powers, with the parliament having legislative authority. The South African parliament consists of the National Assembly and the National Council of Provinces. **According to the South African Constitution, provinces and local authorities have the power to legislate**, which is why multiple sources for legal queries are discussed later in this article. South Africa's judiciary includes the Constitutional Court, Supreme Court of Appeal, High Courts, and Magistrates' Courts. The Constitutional Court is the highest court, dealing exclusively with constitutional matters, distinguishing it from other countries.

Note: South Africa taxes residents on worldwide income and non-residents on income sourced within South Africa, with a corporate tax rate of 28%. Notably, in 2019, South Africa became the first African country to implement a carbon tax.

Now, let’s delve into the methods for querying South African laws.

## II. Methods for Querying South African Laws

As mentioned earlier, the South African Constitution grants legislative powers to both central and local authorities, so law queries are divided into central and provincial levels. We will start with the central level:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/001.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The [South African Government website](https://www.gov.za/#external) is the official portal for accessing various documents. As shown in the image, you can query laws, the Constitution, bills, drafts, etc., under the "Documents" section:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/002.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As shown above, you can search using keywords, document types, topics, and date ranges. Document types include:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/003.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Topics are shown below:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/004.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Due to space constraints, not all topics are listed here. Users can filter based on their needs.

Documents are provided as PDF attachments for download. Users can view them online or download them for offline reading.

Next, we introduce the methods for querying laws in each of the nine provinces (refer to the previous text for reasons):

(1) Eastern Cape Province:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/005.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Users can query policies directly on the provincial government website. Note that the content is provided as PDF files, so you cannot search the content directly on the website.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/006.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

(2) Free State Province:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/007.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The law queries for this province are straightforward, with appropriate classifications provided. As shown above, laws, bills, and regulations designated by the province can be found under the "Legislation" section. Here is an example of laws designated by the province:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/008.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The documents are arranged in reverse chronological order, with the most recent documents at the top. All files are in PDF format, available for online viewing or download.

(3) Gauteng Province:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/009.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Under "Media-Publications" on the government website, you can find relevant laws:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/010.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Note that the website supports filtered searches:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/011.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Users can filter by category, subcategory, etc., according to their needs. All files are provided in PDF format.

(4) KwaZulu-Natal Province:

(6) Mpumalanga Province:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/016.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The provincial website does not have a clear law document query entry, which may hinder user experience. Users may find it difficult to query relevant legal documents directly. Therefore, a direct link to the province's legal page is provided here for convenience: [Go to the province's legal page](http://www.mpumalanga.gov.za/legislature/legislature.htm#external):

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/017.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

(7) Northern Cape Province:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/018.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

In the "DOCUMENTS" section under "POLICIES AND LEGISLATION" on the provincial website, you can query relevant legal documents:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/019.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

South Africa has multiple official languages. You can switch the language using the toggle at the top right (marked in red). The lower red box indicates the province's legal documents. Users can browse and read specific documents according to their needs.

(8) North West Province:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/020.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The provincial website does not have a clear legal information query entry. Instead, it provides statements and media releases from the legislative committee. Users can search within the page for queries:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/021.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

(9) Western Cape Province:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/022.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The website provides a very clear entry for legal information queries. You can query under "Policies and Legislation" in the "Documents" section:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/023.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

You can see different levels of legal documents marked in red. Users can browse according to their needs. Here is an example of Acts:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/024.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Note that the left side shows the Acts in chronological order, so select the red box for queries:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100007/025.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Clicking on a specific document provides the Act number, effective date, issuing authority, and the original text for users to understand.

The above covers all official methods and corresponding entries for querying South African laws, including both parliamentary and provincial queries. This compilation is not easy but hopes to help those in need. Next, let's introduce the methods for querying South African tax laws.

## III. Methods for Querying South African Tax Laws
