## 1. Basic Information about Brazilian Law

Brazil, renowned worldwide as the kingdom of football, is located in the eastern part of South America. It has a vast territory, accounting for about half of South America's land area. The northern part features the world's largest Amazon Basin, while the southern part boasts the world's second-largest Brazilian Highlands. The Amazon River, which has the largest flow rate in the world, flows through the country. As a former Portuguese colony, the official language is Portuguese. Therefore, the languages of the websites introduced later are also in Portuguese, and I will provide a brief translation for each module accordingly.

Brazil follows the civil law system, with legislative power belonging to the parliament as stipulated by the Constitution. Brazil has a bicameral parliament: the Senate, composed of three senators from each of the 26 states and the Federal District, and the House of Representatives, which elects 513 representatives proportionally. In this regard, Brazil is similar to the United States. A unique aspect is that Brazilian senators serve an eight-year term, while in other countries, the term is generally four years.

The Constitution is the supreme law, but each state can establish its own state constitution and laws based on the federal Constitution. Therefore, when searching for laws, if you want to obtain comprehensive information, you need to check both federal and state constitutions and laws, as well as other legally effective documents. The advantage is that Brazil provides an official one-stop search portal, but the downside is the lack of multilingual support.

Below is an introduction to the methods of searching for laws. As mentioned earlier, I will provide brief translations for comparison to help readers understand.

## 2. Methods of Searching for Brazilian Laws

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100004/001.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As shown in the figure, this website is hosted by the Brazilian Senate and brings together constitutions, laws, judgments, drafts, and other legal information from the federal and state levels in Brazil. Therefore, searching for relevant Brazilian laws on this website can achieve one-stop searching. A highlight of this website is that documents are named according to URN (Uniform Resource Name) to ensure permanent access and prevent loss. The default search is comprehensive, but users can refine their searches according to their needs, such as laws, decrees, judgments, drafts, etc. It should be noted that all content is provided in Portuguese, so users unfamiliar with the language can use tools like Google Translate for assistance.

In the lower left corner of the red box in the image, there is a manual (usage guide), but it is entirely in Portuguese. Therefore, I will introduce the basic search methods here:

1. Basic Search: Users can perform simple searches using keywords, law numbers, acronyms, publication dates, etc.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100004/002.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As shown in the image above, the left red box indicates the categories of legal documents. For example, the first category includes laws, administrative, judicial, resolutions, and published documents. The second category defines the geographic effectiveness: whether it is nationwide, federal, or state-level. The third category is the issuing institution, which is necessary since the website consolidates regulatory documents issued by various departments. Further categories include language, author, publication year, and other related filtering information.

The right red box indicates the complete attributes of a legal document on this website. Here is a specific explanation:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100004/003.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As shown: The first attribute indicates the geographical effectiveness of the law, the second is the issuing institution, the third is the document title, the fourth is the publication date, the fifth is a summary of the law’s content, and the bottom one is the URN mentioned earlier, which is the unique identifier of the document. If users need to cite this document, they can directly use this URN, which will always be accessible. The specific usage method is: "website address/urn/urn/document's URN address." For example:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100004/004.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

This demonstrates how the official website uses the documents themselves.

2. Advanced Search: Advanced search provides more detailed filtering criteria, such as geographic effectiveness, document category, issuing institution, index, topic, title, document number, publication time, etc., as indicated by the left red box in the image:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100004/005.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As mentioned earlier, this website offers a one-stop search, including federal and state-level legal documents, so users can complete a nationwide legal search directly on this site without needing to search each state individually. This greatly reduces the workload for users.

## 3. Methods of Searching for Brazilian Tax Laws

The Brazilian Federal Revenue website provides a one-stop service, including tax information consultation, declaration, payment, and refund, and it also integrates tax law searches:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100004/006.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Users with an account can directly click the blue background Entrar (English: Enter) at the top right to log in. If you don't have an account, you need to register first. Here’s how to search for legal information: click the red box indicated in the image above, and the new interface will appear as shown:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100004/007.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

I have translated the parts related to tax law searches. Generally, at the federal level, you can directly check the legislacao section (legislation). When specific state-level information is needed, go to the corresponding state.

Here, I will use income tax search as an example:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100004/008.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As shown in the figure, the search results show laws from 1965 to 1988. By clicking and searching for income tax, you can find the relevant legal documents.
