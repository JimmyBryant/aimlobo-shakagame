{{< summary >}}

In the [previous article]((../100013)), we discussed the stamp duty applicable to individuals purchasing residential properties. In this article, we continue exploring other taxes involved in the property purchasing process.

Continuing from the step where both parties sign the contract, according to the [People's Republic of China Deed Tax Law](http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/chinatax/n375/c5155444/content.html#external), Article 1 states:

> When transferring ownership of land or houses within the territory of the People's Republic of China, the transferee, whether an entity or an individual, is liable for deed tax as stipulated by this law.

Article 2 further defines the scope of ownership transfer:

> The transfer of ownership of land or houses refers to the following actions:
>
> (1) Transfer of land-use rights;
> 
> (2) Transfer of land-use rights, including sale, gift, and exchange;
> 
> (3) Sale, gift, or exchange of houses.

From these provisions, it's clear that **the buyer (transferee) is liable for deed tax in property transactions, while the seller (transferor) is exempt**.

Deed tax is essentially a tax levied on changes in ownership of land-use rights and buildings. When we, as individuals, purchase residential property, we acquire ownership of the house and a share of the land-use rights, thus incurring this tax obligation.

Now, how much deed tax do we need to pay? According to Article 3 of the law:

> The deed tax rate ranges from 3% to 5%.

The specific rate is determined by local authorities at the provincial level. Therefore, it's necessary to confirm the exact deed tax rate at the local tax bureau. Here's an example of how to check in a province:

Firstly, go to the [homepage of the State Administration of Taxation of China](http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/chinatax/index.html#external). At the bottom of the page, you'll see the following interface:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100012/001.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Click on the link corresponding to the province for which you want to check the deed tax rate. Taking Beijing as an example, after clicking on Beijing, you'll be directed to the Beijing Taxation Bureau:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100012/002.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Search for the policy and regulations database, then click on deed tax under tax laws to find the specific deed tax rate for that region:

During practical use, make sure to verify the validity of the policy. If it's invalid, perform a search in the query box according to valid regulations to avoid unnecessary losses.

We've covered the deed tax rates. Now, let's discuss the tax base (taxable basis). According to Article 4, Paragraph 1 of the law:

> For the transfer of land-use rights and houses, the transaction price determined by the transfer contract, including the currency and physical assets, corresponds to the price of other economic benefits.

Thus, the price stipulated in the contract is the basis for deed tax. Therefore, **as purchasers, we need to pay deed tax based on the price specified in the purchase contract multiplied by the locally prescribed deed tax rate**. Note that this price does not include value-added tax.

Here are two common situations where **deed tax exemptions** apply (as stipulated in Article 6 of the law):

1. During the duration of a marriage, changes in land or property ownership between spouses.
   
2. Legal heirs acquiring ownership of land or property through inheritance.

Regarding the payment timing for deed tax, the law specifies in Article 9:

> The duty to pay deed tax arises on the day the taxpayer signs the transfer contract of land or property ownership or the day the taxpayer obtains other certificates of transfer of land or property ownership of a contractual nature.

Therefore, the tax obligation arises on the day we sign the property purchase contract. After paying deed tax at the property location, the tax authority will issue a deed tax payment certificate. The real estate registration authority will then issue relevant documents for property certificates upon verification of these certificates.

Now, let's discuss **special considerations (exemptions, reductions)**:

> Urban employees purchasing public housing for the first time are exempt from paying deed tax.

This provision is derived from the same announcement (regarding divorce). Here's a brief introduction to public housing: It refers to residential properties invested and sold by the state, state-owned enterprises, and institutions. Before the residential property is sold, its ownership rights (occupancy rights, use rights, income rights, disposal rights) are owned by the state. Public housing rented by residents is divided into two categories under housing reform policies: salable public housing and non-salable public housing. Both types of housing are use rights housing.

According to the [Ministry of Finance, State Administration of Taxation, Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development Notice on Adjusting Deed Tax and Business Tax Preferential Policies for Real Estate Transaction Links](http://www.chinatax.gov.cn/chinatax/n375/c2137276/content.html#external):

> For individuals purchasing the only family residence (including the purchaser, spouse, and minor children, etc.), with an area of ​​90 square meters or less, deed tax is reduced by 1%; for areas exceeding 90 square meters, deed tax is reduced by 1.5%.
> For individuals purchasing a second family-improvement residence, with an area of ​​90 square meters or less, deed tax is reduced by 1%; for areas exceeding 90 square meters, deed tax is reduced by 2%. The second family-improvement residence refers to a family that already owns one residence and purchases the second residence.

Thus, **for first-time home buyers with a residence of 90 square meters or less, the deed tax rate is 1%. For those with residences larger than 90 square meters, the rate is 1.5%. For second-time home buyers, the rates are 1% for residences of 90 square meters or less and 2% for those larger than 90 square meters**.

This concludes the discussion on the deed tax applicable to individual property purchases. All referenced regulations can be clicked on in blue fonts in this section for further verification of their current validity.
