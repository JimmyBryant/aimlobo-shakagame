## 1. Basic Information on Singapore's Laws

Singapore was once a British colony, serving as a key transshipment port in the Far East and a major military base in Southeast Asia. During World War II, it was briefly occupied by Japan, later becoming part of the Malaysian Federation, and in 1965, it separated from Malaysia to form the Republic of Singapore. The Singapore Constitution establishes a parliamentary republic, with a unicameral parliament and a judicial system comprising the Supreme Court and the Attorney-General's Chambers.

Singapore is a city-state with a unified tax system nationwide. The main current taxes include corporate income tax, personal income tax, goods and services tax, property tax, and stamp duty. Additionally, there are customs duties, betting taxes, and levies on companies hiring foreign workers. Singapore previously had an estate duty, which was abolished on February 15, 2008. Each tax is governed by different laws and regulations, forming the legal framework of Singapore's tax system.

Focusing on income tax, it is the primary source of revenue for the Singapore government. Any income earned or derived from Singapore, or received or deemed received in Singapore, is subject to taxation in Singapore. This means that even income earned or derived from outside Singapore is taxable if received in Singapore. Additionally, income received in Singapore from abroad is also subject to income tax, with certain exemptions such as dividends, branch profits, and service income.

Now, let’s return to the main topic of this article: methods for searching laws.

## 2. Methods for Searching Singapore's Laws

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100008/001.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

[Singapore Statutes Online](https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Index#external) is the official website provided by the Singapore government for searching legal documents. It supports the search for both current and repealed documents, and it allows users to search for primary legislation (Acts) and subsidiary legislation.

The website provides a comprehensive guide (Guide), available under Help--SSO Guide, as shown in the image below. Additionally, the website offers video guides for users who prefer visual learning.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100008/002.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The website is divided into five pages: Home, Browse, Search, Content, and the Favorites page. The Favorites page automatically adds any legal documents that users have marked as favorites, facilitating future browsing.

Here are some basic search methods:

1. Basic Search: This method supports searches by Act title, Act number, and content. By default, it searches by title and number; to search by content, users need to select "content." Searches by title support initialisms, such as “aa” for Accountants Act.

Under Browse, select Current, as shown below:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100008/003.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Users can search by initial letters, select the effective period of the laws, and use PDF download and bookmarking functions.

To search by year, select Acts Supplement from the dropdown menu under Acts in the marked area:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100008/004.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The right-hand side marked area explains the functionality: besides bookmarking, there is "SL," which stands for Subsidiary Legislation. After selecting Acts Supplement, the interface should look like this:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100008/005.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

This allows users to choose by year in the marked area. Overall, the website is user-friendly in terms of search functionality.

Remember the Quick Links at the bottom of the Browse page? These are for frequently searched laws, providing direct links to items like the Constitution.

2. Advanced Search: The website supports advanced search and allows users to save search criteria for future use.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100008/007.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

As shown, advanced search supports basic searches, favorites searches, and stored condition searches. Favorites searches are available only after adding items to favorites, and stored condition searches are possible after saving filter criteria from the previous search. Generally, basic search is sufficient. This search supports AND, OR, NOT functions, and users can add more filter criteria as needed. It is highly convenient and recommended for filtering a large number of documents, as saving search criteria can be very useful for batch processing later on.
