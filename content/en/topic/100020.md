{{< summary >}}

I've been wanting to share this content for a long time. I wonder if any of you had the same experience in math class:

The teacher was explaining:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/001.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

But then my eraser fell, and when I picked it up, this is what I saw:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/002.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

From that moment on, I never understood math class.

Today, I want to share with you two formulas for finding the area of shapes: triangles and circles.

## Area of a Triangle

First, we all know that the area of a rectangle is given by:  S = h * w.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/004.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Then I was told that the area of a triangle is: S = h * w / 2. I followed what the teacher said for many years without questioning why it was so. However, after thinking about it from different perspectives over the years, I think I’ve come to understand the fundamental reasoning behind it.

Here, we won’t discuss the method of combining two triangles to form a quadrilateral. Instead, we’ll explore an alternative approach using integration, involving the abstract concept of infinity.

Let’s start with a triangle:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/005.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

We can divide it into several narrow rectangles. If the width of each rectangle is sufficiently small, the sum of their areas will equal the area of the triangle:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/006.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Let’s divide the width into n equal parts:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/007.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The height is also divided into n equal parts, with each rectangle on the right being shorter by h / n. We denote this as Δh = h / n :

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/008.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Now, let's calculate:

- The area of the first rectangle is: S = w/n * h;
- The area of the second rectangle is: S = w/n * (h - Δh);
- The area of the third rectangle is: S = w/n * (h - Δh * 2);
- ...
- The area of the n rectangle is: S = w/n * (h - Δh * (n-1)).

We sum them all up:

S = w/n * h + w/n * (h - Δh) + … + w/n * (h - Δh * (n-1))

S = w/n * (h + (h - Δh)+ … + (h - Δh * (n-1)))

S = w/n * (h * n - Δh * (1 + 2 + … + (n-1)))

S = w/n * (h * n - Δh * n * n/2)

Since h = Δh * n, we can further simplify:

S = w/n * (h * n - h * n/2)

S = w/n * h * n/2

S = w * h /2

Thus, we derive the area of the triangle as S = w * h /2.

Isn’t that interesting? Let’s continue.

## Circumference of a Circle

Before discussing the area of a circle, let's talk about its circumference.

I don't know if you’ve ever done this, but I tried it myself: drawing a circle with a compass, cutting it out from the paper, and measuring its circumference with a tape measure. I found that the circumference is indeed about six times the radius. The larger and more precise your circle, the closer you’ll get to the exact multiple.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/009.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

We all know the formula for the circumference of a circle is C = 2 * π * r, which can be practically verified using the method I just described.

## Area of a Circle

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/014.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Using the method we applied to calculate the area of a triangle, we can divide a circle into narrow strips, like this:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/010.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

We can then rearrange these strips, as shown here:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/011.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Does it look familiar? It starts to resemble a triangle.

We divide the circle into n equal-width sections, so each strip has a width of r / n.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/012.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The length of the outermost strip is the circumference of the circle, C = 2 * π * r. In the case of the triangle, this corresponds to the height h of the rectangles, while the total width of all strips equals the radius r.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100020/013.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Since it’s now a triangle, we calculate its area using the formula S = w * h /2:

S = w * h /2

S = r * (2 * π * r) /2

S = π * r * r

Thus, we’ve calculated the area of the circle. Isn’t it fascinating?

That’s all for this article. More to come later.
