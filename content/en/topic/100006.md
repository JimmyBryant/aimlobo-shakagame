## 1. Basic Information about Bangladesh Law

Bangladesh is a South Asian country, previously an autonomous province of Pakistan. The rise of various nationalist and democratic movements in the mid-20th century led to the Liberation War for Bangladesh's independence. With India's help, an armed struggle was launched, resulting in the genocide and massacre of civilians in 1971. However, in 1972, the current Bangladesh was established and a constitution was formulated. Bangladesh practices a unicameral parliamentary system, namely the National Parliament. The constitution grants the parliament legislative powers.

Bangladesh is a member of the Commonwealth, and its legal system is derived from British and Indian laws. Unlike other common law countries, **the Supreme Court of Bangladesh has the authority not only to interpret laws enacted by the parliament but also to declare them invalid**. In most other countries, this power is exercised by the parliament or similar institutions. The Supreme Court of Bangladesh is divided into the Appellate Division and the High Court Division, and it is the highest court in the country; other courts and tribunals are subordinate to it. Unlike other countries, the Chief Justice of Bangladesh is appointed by the President, while in some other countries, the parliament directly appoints them.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the government has designated an economic stimulus plan to mitigate the impact of the pandemic on the national economy. This includes tax relief incentives for potential foreign investors, such as a 10-year exemption from corporate income tax for foreign investors and export-oriented manufacturers, exemption from VAT on land lease and bonded warehouse facilities for foreign investors, and more. Additionally, companies that invest $100 million or create 300 jobs will receive a 7-year tax incentive from the Bangladeshi government.

Moreover, due to religious influences (Islam is the state religion), the citizens of Bangladesh do not consume alcohol or pork, and they dislike the number 13. Readers should avoid using this number as much as possible in the country.

Now, back to the main topic of this article: methods for querying laws.

The above image shows the official <a href="http://bdlaws.minlaw.gov.bd/" target="_blank">law query website</a> of Bangladesh, maintained by the Ministry of Law. The site provides options in Bengali and English. It is worth mentioning that Bengali is the national language, and English is the official language. Therefore, the websites we will use later for querying are available in both languages with consistent content, ensuring a good user experience.

The red box at the top right indicates the interface switch button between English and Bengali, with English as the default. The red box below marks the English interface entry. Clicking it will display the following interface:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100006/002.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

The red boxes below indicate the places where you can access the English version of the relevant acts on the left and the Bengali version on the right. Unless otherwise noted, examples in this article will use the English version.

The site also provides basic search guidelines, which, although not detailed, are sufficient for everyday use. The guidelines can be found under Help > How to search:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100006/003.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

1. Basic Search: As shown in the image, the website supports quick indexing in alphabetical order and allows searches by title, content, document number, and year. Notably, **it supports searches by chapters and paragraphs**, indicating that the site's content is meticulously organized for user convenience, with global search as the default.

2. Advanced Search: The advanced search supports queries by relevant document numbers, such as the act year, document number, chapters, and paragraphs.

For everyday use, it is recommended to use the basic search for quick access.

Here’s more about the legal documents:

When users click to view a specific document, since it has been organized, they can view it by chapters and paragraphs. The top right corner shows the document's publication date. The red box below marks the place where users can browse the full text. Users who wish to view the entire content at once can click this button to see the full text.

## 3. Methods for Querying Bangladesh Tax Laws

As mentioned at the beginning, English is the default language for the country's official websites. Users can switch to the Bengali interface if needed. The country's <a href="https://nbr.gov.bd/" target="_blank">tax website link</a>:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100006/007.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Here, the red box at the top right indicates the language selection option. It also mentions that a new tax website has been provided. The new site offers better user-friendliness, so we will use the new tax website for demonstrations, but the functionality remains the same. Users can choose which website to use based on personal preference.

As shown in the image, this is the <a href="https://nbr.portal.gov.bd/" target="_blank">new tax website</a>:

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100006/008.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Under Regulations, we can see documents with different levels of legal authority for various types of taxes, including major taxes like income tax, VAT, and excise tax. To understand the tax laws of a particular type, users can follow the order: Acts-Rules-SROs-GOs, which is arranged from highest to lowest legal authority.

{{< img-res class="img_in_topic" imagePath="/image/topic/100006/009.png" alt="image" imageWidth=70 >}}

Here’s a further explanation of the specific interface. The red box on the top left allows users to adjust the font size and color according to their personal reading habits. The red box on the right informs readers that **the documents provided on this site are all in PDF format, meaning users can read them online or download them for offline reading, but they are not conducive to online editing**.

Lastly, the website includes almost all functions related to taxation, besides the tax law documents mentioned earlier, such as filing, payment, forms, consultation, etc. Additionally, the website has its own mobile application, which users can download if needed. The specific download method is shown in the image:
